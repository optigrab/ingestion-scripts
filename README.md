# ingestion-scripts

This repository is a place to hold bits of code that we hack together to handle ingesting data feeds. There will be a separate repository that holds the real framework that we're going to run, where final versions of this code can live (with tests). But this repository will give a jumping-off point for putting that together.

Please create a directory pertaining to the data feed type (such as "federalregister"). And try to remember not to commit code with API keys or credentials here.
